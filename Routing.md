## 5.1 Routing Algorithms

**Distance Vector Algorithm:** Each router maintains a table with distances to destinations, updating based on information exchanged with neighbors (e.g., RIP protocol).

**Link State Algorithm:** Routers share comprehensive information about network link states to build a shortest path based on the complete network topology for efficient path calculations (e.g., OSPF protocol).

## 5.2 Intra-AS Routing: OSPF

> An autonomous system is identified by its globally unique autonomous system number (ASN). AS numbers, like IP addresses, are assigned by `ICANN` regional registries.

- **Definition:** Routers organized into Autonomous Systems (ASs), each under the same administrative control.
- **AS Identification:** Globally unique Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) assigned by ICANN.
- **Routing Algorithm:** Intra-Autonomous System Routing Protocol.

### 5.2.1 OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

> OSPF is a link state protocol that uses flooding of link state information and a Dijkstra’s least cost path algorithm. With OSPF, each router constructs a complete topological map (that is, a graph) of the entire autonomous system. Each router then locally runs Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm to determine a shortest path tree to all subnets

- **Link State Protocol:**
  - Utilizes flooding of link state information.
  - uses Dijkstra’s least cost path algorithm.
- **Complete Topological Map:**
  - Each router constructs a full topological map of the entire AS.
  - Locally runs Dijkstra’s algorithm to determine shortest path trees.
- **Link Costs:**
  - Configured by the network administrator.
  - Allows flexibility (e.g., minimum hop routing or weights based on link capacity).

### 5.2.2 OSPF Features and Advancements

1. **Security:**
   - Authentication to ensure only trusted routers participate.
   - Supports `simple` and `MD5` authentication, the latter providing higher security.
   - Guards against replay attacks using sequence numbers.

2. **Multiple Same Cost Paths:**
   - OSPF permits the use of multiple paths when several have the same cost.

3. **Integrated Unicast and Multicast Routing:**
   - MOSPF (Multicast OSPF) extends OSPF to support multicast routing.

4. **Hierarchy Support:**
   - OSPF AS can be configured hierarchically into areas.
   - Area Border Routers facilitate routing between areas, with a designated backbone area.

## 5.3 Inter-AS Routing: BGP

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is a fundamental inter autonomous system routing protocol in the Internet. It acts as the glue that binds thousands of ISPs together, facilitating communication across multiple ASs.

### 5.3.1 BGP Responsibilities

- **Destination Representation:** Routes packets to `CIDRized prefixes`, each representing a subnet or a collection of subnets.
- **Advertising Reachability Information:** Allows subnets to advertise their existence across ASs.
- **BGP Connections:**
  - Advertising reachability information through BGP messages.
  - External BGP (eBGP) connections: Between gateway routers in different ASs.
  - Internal BGP (iBGP) connections: Within routers of the same AS.

### Determining the Best Routes

> When a router advertises a prefix across a BGP connection, it includes with the prefix several BGP attributes. In BGP jargon, a prefix along with its attributes is called a route. Two of the more important attributes are `AS-PATH` and `NEXT-HOP`. 

> The AS-PATH attribute contains the list of ASs through which the advertisement has passed. To generate the AS-PATH value, when a prefix is passed to an AS, the AS adds its ASN to the existing list in the AS-PATH. The NEXT-HOP is the IP address of the router interface that begins the AS-PATH.

- **BGP Attributes:**
  - `AS-PATH`: List of ASs through which the advertisement has passed.
  - `NEXT-HOP`: IP address of the router interface starting the AS-PATH.
- **Choosing the Best Route:** Routers choose among various paths based on cost and policy.

Three components: NEXT-HOP; AS-PATH; destination prefix.

```
3d; AS3; X --> 2a; AS2 AS3; X
```

### 5.3.2 Hot Potato Routing in BGP

Hot Potato Routing is a fundamental algorithm in BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) used for selecting the best route to a destination prefix. This algorithm prioritizes getting packets out of an Autonomous System (AS) quickly with minimal cost.

- `Goal`: Quickly move packets out of the AS with the least possible cost.
- `Analogy`: Similar to passing a burning "hot potato" to another person (AS) as quickly as possible.
- `Selfish Algorithm`: Focuses on reducing costs within its AS, ignoring other end to end costs outside the AS.

#### Algorithm Overview

1. **Learn Routes:**
   - Router 1b learns about two possible BGP routes to prefix x.
   
2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - Utilizes intra AS routing information to find the least cost intra AS path to NEXT-HOP routers (2a and 3d).
   - Defines cost as the number of links traversed.

3. **Route Selection:**
   - Selects the route with the smallest of these least cost paths.
   - Example: Cost to router 2a is 2, cost to router 3d is 3, so router 2a is selected.

4. **Forwarding Table Update:**
   - Consults the forwarding table (configured by intra AS algorithm) to find the interface (I) on the least cost path to router 2a.
   - Adds (x, I) to its forwarding table.

5. **Adding Outside AS Prefix**
    - When adding an outside AS prefix to the forwarding table, both inter AS (BGP) and intra AS (e.g., OSPF) routing protocols are utilized.

### 5.3.3 IP Anycast in BGP

BGP is also utilized for implementing the IP anycast service. `IP anycast` is used in applications like DNS to replicate content across dispersed geographical locations, ensuring users access the nearest server. IP Anycast in BGP facilitates efficient content distribution by leveraging BGP's route selection capabilities.

#### Implementation in CDN (Content Delivery Network)

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ABLVV864FDCHULkGWDYpKV8xXjS0m7oS4lKLhOqi1jNCNc7li0xhyTEgzTOzb-FrM-dMoiFY0ZvFG8tt34J4zKpL3ca4WeItSS7V8YE3KdDGRN5cqzhkZJ5XCX9fLfxcv0coumD5uEBVYEnuYla-zvYuhw5A=w1544-h1094-s-no?authuser=1" width="60%" height="auto">

1. **IP-Anycast Configuration:**
   - CDN assigns the same IP address to all servers.
   - Standard BGP is used to advertise this IP address from each server.

2. **BGP Route Selection Algorithm:**
   - BGP routers treat multiple route advertisements for the same IP address as different paths to the same physical location.
   - Local BGP route selection algorithm is applied to choose the "best" route (e.g., closest in AS hop counts).

3. **Routing Table Configuration:**
   - Each router configures its routing table to route packets to the chosen location based on the BGP route selection.

4. **Content Distribution:**
   - CDN distributes content, and when a client requests the common IP address, routers forward the request to the "closest" server as per BGP route selection.
