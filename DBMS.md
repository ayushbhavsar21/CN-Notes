# DBMS

A *DBMS* is software that manages databases. It provides an efficient way to store, retrieve, and update data while ensuring security, consistency, and reliability. It supports features like data abstraction, reduced redundancy, query processing, and multi-user access. Examples include *MySQL, Oracle, and MongoDB*.

---

## Data vs Information

- *Data*: Raw facts  
- *Information*: Processed, organized data

---

## DBMS Architecture

DBMS architecture can be described in two ways:

1. *System Architecture*: 1-tier, 2-tier, or 3-tier, depending on how client, server, and application layers interact.  
2. *Three-Schema Architecture*: External schema (user views), conceptual schema (logical structure), and internal schema (physical storage).

This separation ensures *data abstraction, security, and flexibility*.

---

### 1. Types of Architecture

#### 1-Tier  
- User interacts directly with the database.  
- Mostly used by developers for testing.

#### 2-Tier  
- Client communicates with the database server directly.  
- Example: simple applications using *JDBC/ODBC*.  
  - *ODBC*: Open Database Connectivity (Microsoft, C)  
  - *JDBC*: Java Database Connectivity

#### 3-Tier  
- Adds an *application server* between client and DB server.  
- Improves *scalability, security, and abstraction*.  
- Common in *web applications*.

---

### 2. Three-Schema Architecture (Most Asked in Interviews)

1. *External Level (View Level):* Describes how end users see the data. Multiple user views possible.  
2. *Conceptual Level (Logical Level):* Describes structure of the database as a whole. Defines entities, relationships, constraints.  
3. *Internal Level (Physical Level):* Defines how data is physically stored using indexes, files, and storage structures.

## ER Diagram

### Definition  
An *ER (Entity‚ÄìRelationship) Diagram* is a visual representation of the data model of a system.  
It shows entities (objects), their attributes, and the relationships between them.  
It is used in database design to map real-world requirements into a structured database schema.

---

### Key Components of ER Diagram

#### 1. Entity  
- Object or concept that stores data.  
- *Strong Entity*: Has its own primary key (e.g., Student, Employee).  
- *Weak Entity*: Cannot be uniquely identified without another entity (e.g., OrderItem depends on Order).

#### 2. Attributes  
- Properties of entities.  
- *Simple Attribute*: Cannot be divided (Name, Age).  
- *Composite Attribute*: Can be split (FullName ‚Üí FirstName + LastName).  
- *Derived Attribute*: Value can be derived from others (Age from DOB).  
- *Multivalued Attribute*: Can have multiple values (Phone Numbers).

#### 3. Relationship  
- Association between entities.  
- *Types*: One-to-One (1:1), One-to-Many (1:N), Many-to-Many (M:N).  
- Represented using *diamonds* in ER diagrams.

#### 4. Keys  
- *Primary Key*: Unique identifier of an entity.  
- *Foreign Key*: Attribute that links entities.

## Relational Model

- Proposed by *E.F. Codd (1970)*.  
- Represents data as *tables (relations)* with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).  
- Each table has *constraints* to ensure data integrity.  
- Relationships between tables are defined using *keys*.

---

### Types of Keys in Relational Model

1. *Super Key*  
   - A set of one or more attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple.  
   - Example: {StudentID}, {StudentID, Name}.

2. *Candidate Key*  
   - Minimal super key (no unnecessary attributes).  
   - Example: StudentID or Email.

3. *Primary Key*  
   - One chosen candidate key.  
   - Cannot be NULL or duplicate.  
   - Example: StudentID.

4. *Alternate Key*  
   - Candidate keys not chosen as primary key.  
   - Example: If Email is not chosen as primary key, it becomes an alternate key.

5. *Foreign Key*  
   - Attribute in one relation that references the primary key in another relation.  
   - Maintains *referential integrity*.  
   - Example: CourseID in Enrollment table referencing Course table.

6. *Composite Key*  
   - Key formed by combining two or more attributes.  
   - Example: (StudentID, CourseID) in Enrollment table.

7. *Unique Key*  
   - Similar to primary key but allows one NULL.  
   - Example: PhoneNumber in Student table (unique but may be NULL).

---

## Integrity & Consistency

- *Integrity* in DBMS is maintained using constraints like primary key, foreign key, domain rules, and business rules.  
- *Consistency* is ensured through *ACID properties* of transactions.  
- Together, they prevent invalid, duplicate, or conflicting data.

## Types of SQL Commands ‚Äì Interview Answer

SQL commands are grouped into categories based on what they do with the database.

---

### **1. DDL (Data Definition Language)**

Used to define and manage database structure.

* **CREATE** ‚Üí Creates objects (table, database).

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Student (
      StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      Name VARCHAR(50),
      Age INT
  );
  ```
* **ALTER** ‚Üí Modifies an existing object.

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Student ADD Email VARCHAR(100);
  ```
* **DROP** ‚Üí Deletes an object.

  ```sql
  DROP TABLE Student;
  ```
* **TRUNCATE** ‚Üí Removes all rows but keeps structure.

  ```sql
  TRUNCATE TABLE Student;
  ```

---

### **2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)**

Used to manipulate data inside tables.

* **INSERT**

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Student (StudentID, Name, Age) VALUES (1, 'Ayush', 21);
  ```
* **UPDATE**

  ```sql
  UPDATE Student SET Age = 22 WHERE StudentID = 1;
  ```
* **DELETE**

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM Student WHERE StudentID = 1;
  ```

---

### **3. DQL (Data Query Language)**

Used to query and fetch data.

* **SELECT**

  ```sql
  SELECT Name, Age FROM Student WHERE Age > 20;
  ```

---

### **4. DCL (Data Control Language)**

Used for permissions and access control.

* **GRANT** ‚Üí Gives user privileges.

  ROLLBACK TO sp1;
  ```

---

**Query Language (DQL)**

- *DQL* mainly has the *SELECT* statement.  
- Clauses: *WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY* are used to refine and structure queries.


## üìå **Normalization in DBMS**
---
### üîπ **Definition**

Normalization is the **process of organizing data** in a database to reduce **redundancy (duplication)** and improve **data integrity**.
It transforms large, complex tables into smaller, related ones.

---

### üìå **Normal Forms (NFs)**

There are several normal forms (rules). The most common ones used are:

---

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **First Normal Form (1NF)**

**Rule**:

* Data must be in **tabular format** (rows & columns).
* Each cell must hold **atomic (indivisible)** values (no repeating groups, no arrays).
* Each record must be unique.

**How to achieve 1NF**:

* Remove repeating groups.
* Break down multivalued attributes into separate rows.

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Second Normal Form (2NF)**

**Rule**:

* Must already be in **1NF**.
* No **partial dependency**: Non-key attributes must depend on the **whole primary key**, not part of it.
  *(Applies only if composite key exists)*

**How to achieve 2NF**:

* If non-key attributes depend on only part of the composite key ‚Üí move them to a new table with that part as primary key.

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Third Normal Form (3NF)**

**Rule**:

* Must already be in **2NF**.
* No **transitive dependency**: Non-key attributes must not depend on another non-key attribute.

**How to achieve 3NF**:

* Remove attributes that depend on other non-key attributes into a separate table.

---

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**

**Rule**:

* A stronger version of 3NF.
* For every functional dependency (X ‚Üí Y), **X should be a super key**.

---

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**

**Rule**:

* Must already be in **BCNF**.
* No **multi-valued dependencies** (MVDs).
* A multi-valued dependency means one attribute can determine multiple independent sets of values.

**Example (Before 4NF):**

| Student | Hobby    | Language |
| ------- | -------- | -------- |
| Alice   | Chess    | English  |
| Alice   | Chess    | French   |
| Alice   | Painting | English  |
| Alice   | Painting | French   |

Here, **Hobbies** and **Languages** are independent of each other but are stored together ‚Üí redundancy.

**Solution (After 4NF):**

* Split into two tables:

**Student‚ÄìHobby**

| Student | Hobby    |
| ------- | -------- |
| Alice   | Chess    |
| Alice   | Painting |

**Student‚ÄìLanguage**

| Student | Language |
| ------- | -------- |
| Alice   | English  |
| Alice   | French   |

‚úÖ Now no multi-valued dependency ‚Üí in **4NF**.

---

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Fifth Normal Form (5NF or PJNF ‚Äì Project Join Normal Form)**

**Rule**:

* Must already be in **4NF**.
* No **join dependency** ‚Äî data should not be decomposable into multiple tables that need to be recombined with joins unnecessarily.
* In other words - It cannot be further decomposed into smaller tables without losing information.
* In short: avoid redundancy that occurs due to complex relationships.


‚úÖ **5NF ensures** the table cannot be split further without losing data or introducing redundancy.

---
### üìå **Summary of All Normal Forms**

| Normal Form | Removes                             | Example Issue Solved                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **1NF**     | Repeating groups, non-atomic values | Multiple values in one cell                |
| **2NF**     | Partial dependency                  | Non-key depending on part of composite key |
| **3NF**     | Transitive dependency               | Non-key depending on another non-key       |
| **BCNF**    | More strict FDs                     | Every determinant must be superkey         |
| **4NF**     | Multi-valued dependency             | Independent multi-valued attributes        |
| **5NF**     | Join dependency                     | Complex redundancy from joins              |
| **6NF**     | Temporal / advanced join deps       | Time-dependent attributes                  |

---

‚úÖ **In real-world systems**:

* **3NF/BCNF** is usually enough for OLTP (transactional DBs).
* **4NF/5NF** for advanced enterprise DBs with complex relationships.
* **6NF** for data warehouses & temporal DBs.

## Transaction in DBMS

### **Definition**

A **transaction** is a single logical unit of work in a database. It may consist of one or multiple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) (queries, updates, insertions, deletions) operations that are executed as a whole. A transaction ensures that the database moves from one **consistent state** to another, even in the presence of failures.

Example: In a **bank transfer**, deducting money from one account and adding it to another must either both happen or none happen.

---

### **Properties of Transactions (ACID)**

1. **Atomicity** ‚Üí All operations in a transaction execute completely or none at all.

   * Example: Debit succeeds but credit fails ‚Üí rollback entire transaction.
2. **Consistency** ‚Üí Database must remain in a valid state before and after the transaction.

   * Example: Total balance in system remains same after transfer.
3. **Isolation** ‚Üí Concurrent transactions execute independently without interfering.

   * Example: Two users booking the same seat ‚Üí DBMS ensures only one succeeds.
4. **Durability** ‚Üí Once committed, changes are permanent, even if system crashes.

---

### **Transaction States**

* **Active** ‚Üí When execution is in progress.
* **Partially Committed** ‚Üí After the last statement executed but before changes are made permanent.
* **Committed** ‚Üí Successfully completed and changes saved.
* **Failed** ‚Üí Error occurs, cannot proceed.
* **Aborted** ‚Üí Rolled back to previous consistent state.

<img width="910" height="415" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcd5a661-4357-4bcb-ae52-4a15947b3ad6" />


---

### **Control Commands (TCL)**

* `BEGIN TRANSACTION` ‚Üí Start.
* `COMMIT` ‚Üí Save changes.
* `ROLLBACK` ‚Üí Undo changes.
* `SAVEPOINT` ‚Üí Set a point to rollback to.

---
## How is ACID properties are incorporated in Transaction
---

### 1. **Atomicity**

* **Meaning**: A transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit. Either all operations succeed, or none do.
* **Implementation in DBMS**:

  * **Undo/rollback logs**: If part of a transaction fails, changes are rolled back using logs.
  * **Write-ahead logging (WAL)**: Before any data is changed, the intended update is recorded in a log. This ensures rollback is possible.
  * Example: If money is transferred between two accounts, either debit and credit both happen, or neither.

---

### 2. **Consistency**

* **Meaning**: The database must move from one valid state to another valid state, preserving all rules (constraints, triggers, cascades).
* **Implementation in DBMS**:

  * **Constraints**: Primary keys, foreign keys, unique, not-null, check constraints ensure rules are not violated.
  * **Referential integrity**: Ensures relationships between tables remain valid.
  * Example: You cannot insert an order with a customer ID that doesn‚Äôt exist.

---

### 3. **Isolation**

* **Meaning**: Transactions execute independently of each other. Intermediate states of a transaction are not visible to others.
* **Implementation in DBMS**:

  * **Locking protocols**: Shared locks, exclusive locks prevent conflicts.
  * **Isolation levels**: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable (ANSI SQL levels).
  * **Concurrency control**: Techniques like 2-Phase Locking (2PL), Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC).
  * Example: While one transaction is transferring money, another transaction cannot read a half-updated balance.

---

### 4. **Durability**

* **Meaning**: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent‚Äîeven in case of crash or power loss.
* **Implementation in DBMS**:

  * **Write-ahead logs** ensure committed transactions are stored on disk.
  * **Checkpointing**: Periodically saves database state.
  * **Replication & backups**: Extra measures for ensuring data survives failures.
  * Example: If you book a ticket and system crashes, the booking should still be confirmed when it comes back online.

---
‚úÖ **In summary**:

* **Atomicity** ‚Üí via transaction logs & rollbacks
* **Consistency** ‚Üí via constraints & rules
* **Isolation** ‚Üí via locks & concurrency control
* **Durability** ‚Üí via logs, checkpoints, and recovery mechanisms


## üìå **Indexing in DBMS**

### üîπ **Definition**

Indexing is a **data structure technique** used to quickly locate and access data in a database. It works like an index in a book ‚Üí speeds up searches instead of scanning every record (full table scan).

Indexing is used to optimise the performance of a database by minimising the number of disk accesses required when a query is processed.

---

### üîπ **Why Indexing?**

* **Faster query execution** (search, update, delete).
* **Improves performance** of `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`.
* **Reduces disk I/O**.
* **Drawback**: Takes extra storage & overhead for updates (insert/delete must update index too).

---

### üîπ **Types of Indexing**

### 1. **Primary Index**

* Built automatically on **primary key**.
* One index per table.
* Records are stored in **sorted order of primary key**.

### 2. **Secondary Index**

* Created manually on **non-primary attributes**.
* Allows **multiple indexes per table**.
* Supports searching on non-key columns.

### 3. **Clustered Index**

* **Sorts and stores** rows physically in table based on index key.
* Only **one clustered index** per table (since data can be stored one way).

### 4. **Non-Clustered Index**

* Separate structure; stores **pointers to data** instead of actual rows.
* Multiple non-clustered indexes can exist.
### 5. **Multilevel Index**
* Uses multiple levels of indexing (like B+ trees) for large datasets.
---
### **Dense vs Sparse Index**

* **Dense Index** ‚Üí Every record has an entry in index. (Fast lookup, more space).
* **Sparse Index** ‚Üí Only some records have index entries. (Less space, slightly slower).


### üîπ **Index Data Structures**

1. **B-Tree Index**

   * Balanced tree; keeps data sorted.
   * Good for range queries.

2. **B+ Tree Index** (Most used)

   * Leaf nodes hold actual data pointers.
   * Supports **range & equality** queries efficiently.

3. **Hash Index**

   * Uses hashing function.
   * Good for **equality search** (e.g., `WHERE id = 10`).
   * Not suitable for range queries.

---

### üîπ **Advantages**

* Very fast search, retrieval, and join.
* Reduces I/O operations.
* Makes sorting and grouping faster.

### üîπ **Disadvantages**

* Extra space required.
* Slows down **insert, update, delete** (index must be updated).
* Poor choice for small tables.

---

### üîπ **When to Use Indexing**

‚úÖ Large tables.
‚úÖ Columns used frequently in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`.
‚úÖ High read operations.

‚ùå Not useful for small tables.
‚ùå Columns with high updates.
‚ùå Columns with very low selectivity (like gender = M/F).

---
### ‚úÖ **In Short**

* **Index = Shortcut to data**.
* **Types** ‚Üí Primary, Secondary, Clustered, Non-clustered, Dense, Sparse.
* **Structures** ‚Üí B-Tree, B+Tree, Hash.
* **Trade-off** ‚Üí Fast reads üîÑ Slower writes & extra space.


## üìå **NoSQL Databases**

### üîπ **Definition**

* **NoSQL (Not Only SQL)** databases are **non-relational databases** designed for **scalability, flexibility, and high performance**.
* They do not strictly follow relational DBMS principles (tables, schemas, joins).
* They are schema-less or have dynamic schema and can handle **unstructured / semi-structured data** (JSON, XML, key-value).



### üîπ **Why NoSQL?**

* Handle **Big Data** (huge volume, variety, velocity).
* **Scalable**: Easily distribute data across servers (horizontal scaling).
* **Flexible**: No fixed schema; data model can evolve easily.
* **Fast**: Optimized for specific use cases (key lookups, document queries, graphs).
* Used in **social media, IoT, real-time apps, e-commerce, recommendation systems**.

1. **Key-Value Stores**

* Data stored as key‚Äìvalue pairs.
* Very fast lookups, simple schema.
* **Examples:**
  * Redis
  * Amazon DynamoDB
  * Riak KV
  * Oracle NoSQL Database
  * Aerospike
  * Berkeley DB
  * Voldemort

2. **Document Stores**

* Data stored as documents (JSON, BSON, XML).
* Flexible schema: each document can have different structure.
* **Examples:**
  * MongoDB
  * CouchDB
  * Couchbase
  * Amazon DocumentDB
  * RethinkDB
  * RavenDB
  * MarkLogic
  * ArangoDB (multi-model, supports documents)
 
 3. **Column-Oriented Stores**

* Store data in **columns instead of rows**.
* Optimized for analytical queries and large datasets.
* **Examples:**
  * Apache Cassandra
  * HBase (Hadoop ecosystem)
  * ScyllaDB
  * Google Bigtable
  * Hypertable
  * Accumulo

 4. **Graph Databases**
* Store data as **nodes (entities)** and **edges (relationships)**.
* Best for social networks, recommendations, fraud detection.
* **Examples:**
  * Neo4j
  * Amazon Neptune
  * OrientDB (multi-model, strong graph support)
  * ArangoDB
  * Titan / JanusGraph
  * AllegroGraph
  * TigerGraph

5. **Multi-Model Databases**
* Support more than one NoSQL model (document + graph + key-value).
* **Examples:**
  * ArangoDB (document + graph + key-value)
  * OrientDB (document + graph)
  * Cosmos DB (Microsoft, supports key-value, column, document, graph)
  * MarkLogic

6. **Time-Series Databases**
* Specialized for **time-stamped data** (IoT, monitoring, finance).
* Optimized for high write throughput and time-range queries.
* **Examples:**
  * InfluxDB
  * TimescaleDB (SQL + time-series)
  * OpenTSDB
  * KairosDB

7. **Object-Oriented Databases**
* Store data as **objects** (like in OOP languages).
* Objects persist with attributes and methods.
* **Examples:**
  * db4o
  * ObjectDB

### üîπ **Features of NoSQL**

* **Schema-less / flexible schema**.
* **Horizontal scaling** (add more machines instead of upgrading one).
* **Replication & partitioning** for high availability.
* **Eventual consistency** (CAP theorem ‚Üí often prefer Availability + Partition tolerance over strict Consistency).
* Supports **real-time analytics**.



### üîπ **Advantages**

‚úÖ Handles massive, varied, unstructured data.
‚úÖ Scales horizontally (cloud-friendly).
‚úÖ High performance for read/write operations.
‚úÖ Flexible schema ‚Üí easy to adapt.

### üîπ **Disadvantages**

‚ùå Weaker consistency compared to SQL (many follow **BASE**: Basically Available, Soft-state, Eventually consistent).
‚ùå No standard query language (varies by DB).
‚ùå Limited complex transaction support (compared to SQL ACID).
‚ùå Learning curve.

### üîπ **When to Use NoSQL**

* Applications with **Big Data** (e.g., Facebook, Netflix, Amazon).
* Systems needing **fast reads/writes**.
* **Real-time apps** (chat apps, recommendation engines).
* **Flexible/ evolving schema** requirements.



### ‚úÖ **In Short**

* **NoSQL = Not Only SQL** ‚Üí non-relational, schema-less, distributed DB.
* **Types** ‚Üí Key-Value, Document, Column, Graph.
* **Trade-off** ‚Üí High scalability & speed üîÑ Weaker consistency & transactions.
* Popular DBs ‚Üí MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j, CouchDB, DynamoDB.

## **BASE in NoSQL**

### **Definition**

In NoSQL databases, **BASE** is an alternative to the strict **ACID** model of relational databases. It relaxes consistency requirements to achieve high availability and scalability in distributed systems.

**BASE stands for:**

* **Basically Available** ‚Üí System guarantees availability, even if parts fail.
* **Soft State** ‚Üí Data may be temporarily inconsistent, as updates propagate asynchronously.
* **Eventual Consistency** ‚Üí The system will become consistent over time, if no new updates are made.



### **Why BASE instead of ACID?**

* ACID ensures strict consistency, reliability, and correctness.
* In distributed environments (e.g., large-scale web apps), strict ACID limits performance and scalability.
* BASE sacrifices **immediate consistency** for **availability and partition tolerance**, aligning with the **CAP theorem**.

 ## **CAP vs ACID/BASE mapping**

### **1. ACID (SQL / RDBMS)**

* **Strong Consistency** ‚Üí Always correct and reliable.
* Fits best with **CP** in CAP theorem:

  * **C**: Consistency maintained
  * **P**: Partition tolerance required in distributed systems
  * **A**: Availability sometimes sacrificed (e.g., if nodes are partitioned, system may reject requests to preserve consistency).
* **Example**: Traditional RDBMS (PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL with strict transactions).

### **2. BASE (NoSQL / Distributed DBs)**

* **Eventual Consistency** ‚Üí Availability prioritized, consistency relaxed.
* Fits best with **AP** in CAP theorem:

  * **A**: High availability guaranteed
  * **P**: Partition tolerance ensured
  * **C**: Consistency is eventual, not immediate
* **Example**: Cassandra, DynamoDB, Riak.

### **3. Hybrid Systems**

Some modern databases allow **tunable consistency** ‚Üí user chooses C vs A per operation.

* **Examples**: MongoDB, Cosmos DB.

### **Interview-Ready Summary Table**

| Model      | Philosophy                                            | CAP Mapping                                                            | Example DBs                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **ACID**   | Strong consistency, reliable transactions             | **CP** (Consistency + Partition tolerance, may sacrifice Availability) | Oracle, MySQL (InnoDB), PostgreSQL |
| **BASE**   | Basically available, soft state, eventual consistency | **AP** (Availability + Partition tolerance, relaxed Consistency)       | Cassandra, DynamoDB, Riak          |
| **Hybrid** | Tunable consistency (choose per query)                | Can behave as CP or AP depending on config                             | MongoDB, Cosmos DB                 |


## üìå **CAP Theorem in DBMS/NoSQL**

### üîπ **Definition**

Proposed by **Eric Brewer**, CAP theorem states that in a **distributed database system**, you can only guarantee **two** of the following three properties at the same time:

1. **Consistency (C)**

   * Every read receives the **most recent write** (all nodes see the same data).
   * Example: If you update your profile picture, everyone should see the latest one instantly.

2. **Availability (A)**

   * Every request gets a **response**, even if it may not be the latest data.
   * Example: Even during server issues, your profile still loads (maybe old data).

3. **Partition Tolerance (P)**

   * System continues to work even if there is a **network partition** (communication failure between nodes).
   * Example: If servers in two regions cannot talk to each other, both should still keep working.

---

### üîπ **CAP in Simple Words**

* In a distributed system, **network failures are inevitable**, so **Partition Tolerance (P)** is a must.
* That means databases must **choose between Consistency (C) and Availability (A)**.

---

### üîπ **CAP Theorem & NoSQL**

#### 1. **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**

* Guarantees **correct data**, but might sacrifice **availability** during failures.
* Example: **HBase, MongoDB (in some configs), Redis (clustered)**.
* Use case: Banking, payments (must be consistent).

#### 2. **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)**

* Guarantees system is **always up**, but data may be **eventually consistent** (not always latest).
* Example: **Cassandra, DynamoDB, CouchDB, Riak**.
* Use case: Social media feeds, shopping carts, recommendation engines.

#### 3. **CA (Consistency + Availability)**

* Works well in a **single-node system** (not distributed).
* Not practical in large distributed systems, since partition failures are inevitable.
* Example: **Traditional RDBMS (Oracle, MySQL in standalone mode)**.

---

### üîπ **Relation Between NoSQL & CAP**

* NoSQL databases are **distributed systems**, so **Partition Tolerance (P)** is mandatory.
* That forces a choice:

  * Some NoSQL DBs are **CP** (prefer consistency over availability).
  * Some NoSQL DBs are **AP** (prefer availability over consistency).
* Hence, **NoSQL design decisions are guided by CAP theorem**.

---

### ‚úÖ **In Short**

* **CAP Theorem**: Only 2 of **Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance** can be achieved simultaneously.
* **NoSQL DBs**: Must choose between **CP** or **AP** (since P is required).
* **Trade-off**:

  * CP ‚Üí Accurate but may be unavailable.
  * AP ‚Üí Always available but may return stale data.

---
üëâ Example to remember:

* **Banking app** ‚Üí needs **CP** (accuracy > availability).
* **Instagram/Netflix** ‚Üí needs **AP** (availability > strict accuracy, eventual consistency is fine).

### üìå **Examples of Databases under CAP**

üîπ **CA (Consistency + Availability, No Partition Tolerance)**

* Works well only in **single-node** or tightly coupled systems (since real-world distributed systems must tolerate partitions).
* **Examples**:

  * **Traditional RDBMS (non-distributed)** ‚Üí Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL (standalone mode).
  * They guarantee **consistency** and **availability** as long as no partition occurs.

---

üîπ **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance, sacrificing Availability)**

* Prioritizes **correct data** even if some nodes become unavailable.
* During a network partition, some requests may be denied (not available).
* **Examples**:

  * **HBase**
  * **MongoDB (default configs)**
  * **Redis (clustered, with strong consistency mode)**
* **Use case**: Banking systems, stock trading, payment gateways (where stale/wrong data is unacceptable).

---

üîπ **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance, sacrificing Consistency)**

* Prioritizes **system uptime** ‚Üí every request gets a response, even if data is slightly outdated.
* Uses **eventual consistency** (data becomes consistent over time).
* **Examples**:

  * **Cassandra**
  * **DynamoDB (Amazon)**
  * **CouchDB**
  * **Riak**
* **Use case**: Social media, shopping carts, recommendation systems (stale data is tolerable).
